# Object Recognition in 2D medical images
This is a project on segmentation and object recognition in 2D medical images using deep learning. An automated system to help characterize histopathology images of cancerous cells. There are two main parts to this project, detecting the cells and then classifying them. A key question in cancer research is why two people with the same broad cancer type (e.g. colon cancer) have different outcomes from treatment. One patient will receive treatment and be healthy, and another will receive the same treatment and have a cancer recurrence in a few years. Recent work with genetics and imaging data has begun to break broad classes of cancer into smaller subsets involving different phenotypes of tumors; that in turn respond differently to treatment. One of the barriers to this analysis is characterizing the cell distribution within the tumor to analyze its spatial arrangement (e.g. tightly clustered, vs disperse) or its composition in terms of different types of cell nuclei (see the manuscript for details).
